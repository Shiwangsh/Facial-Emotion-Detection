## Since breast cancer is by far the most frequent disease in women, it's critical to have a precise and reliable method for diagnosing whether a tumor is benign or malignant. In the year 2020, 276,00 new cases of invasive and 48,000 new non-invasive instances of breast cancer were recorded in the United States according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Putting these figures in perspective, 64 percent of these cases are discovered early in the disease's cycle, giving patients a 99 percent chance of survival. Deep Learning approaches are increasingly routinely used in breast cancer classification. They have exceptional categorization and diagnostic accuracy. The goal of this research is to provide an overview of the fundamental ideas and achievements in artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis.
