# Facial-Emotion-Detection

## Identifying expressions that transmit fundamental emotions like as fear, pleasure, and disgust, among others, is known as facial emotion recognition. It is useful in human-computer interactions and may be used in areas such as digital advertising, online gaming, customer feedback evaluation, and healthcare. (Khaireddin and Chen, n.d.)
Sentiment analysis, which detects facial expressions, is a handy technique for determining a customer's mood, emotion, or attention level in real time.


## 1. Aims and Objective:
The general aims of the project along with the objectives are mentioned below:
Aims:
a.	Design and implement an image classifier 
b.	The aforementioned classifier must be able to recognize at least five different emotions
c.	The model must have reasonable performance(accuracy/loss) 
d.	Implementation of additional features 
Objectives:
a.	Work on a dataset containing various close up facial expressions
b.	Implement a model which allows for maximum accuracy
c.	Research various related works to gain a proper vison on the problem analysis 
d.	Conduct proper evaluation and tests to assure modelâ€™s efficiency
